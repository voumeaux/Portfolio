      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hello, My name is Jonathan! I'm a self taught hobbyist programmer.
         I began programming when I was around 13 years old!
         Ever since I was little I was always facinated by computers.
         I would dedicate most of my time on the computer making little games in scratch or ROBLOX.
         I wanted to learn how this was possible, and that is how I discovered programming.
         The first programming langauge I picked up was python. I liked its simplistic nature & it was easy to work with.
         As time went on, I had the chance to formally take a class dedicated to programming and that is what led me to this moment.
