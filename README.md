# Portfolio
Hey there! I’m Jonathan! a college student currently studying Computer Science.
This repository is a growing collection of my projects, experiments, and learning experiences as I continue to sharpen my technical skills and explore the world of technology.

I’m passionate about hands on, practical learning building, breaking, and fixing things to truly understand how they work. My current focus areas include:
🐧 Linux systems and command-line mastery
🕵️ Network analysis with tools like Wireshark
🔐 Cybersecurity fundamentals exploring ethical hacking, digital forensics, and system hardening

This portfolio will evolve over time. Future updates will include:
App Development
Web Programming
Real-world network security labs
Linux administration and configuration projects
Python automation scripts
Capture the Flag (CTF) practice and write-ups
And much more as I expand my skill set!
