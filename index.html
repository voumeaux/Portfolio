      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hello, My name is Jonathan! I'm a self taught hobbyist programmer.
         I first discovered programming when I was about 13 years old. From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and spent countless hours exploring them.
        Much of my time went into creating small games in Scratch and ROBLOX, which sparked my curiosity about how these platforms actually worked. That curiosity led me to programming.
         The first language I learned was Python, and I was immediately drawn to its simplicity and ease of use. 
        As my interest grew, I eventually had the opportunity to take a formal programming class, which deepened my knowledge and solidified my passion. 
        That journey has brought me to where I am today continuing to learn, build, and grow as a programmer.
